# # Geospatial Analysis for Mortgage Risk Assessment: A Data-Driven Approach to Flood Risk Evaluation

# ##Executive Summary
In this project, I outline a data-driven approach to assess mortgage risks, specifically focusing on flood risk. Leveraging geospatial data, I aim to provide a comprehensive analysis that aids lenders and investors in making informed decisions. This approach includes two perspectives: geocoding-based risk assessment and shapefile integration for enhanced spatial context. The project utilizes fictitious property data and advanced risk simulation techniques to deliver actionable insights into mortgage risk management.##Introduction###Background and ContextIn the current financial landscape, accurate risk assessment is crucial for mortgage lenders and investors. Traditional methods often fail to consider environmental factors, such as flood risk, which can significantly impact property values and loan default rates. With climate change increasing the frequency and severity of flooding events, incorporating flood risk into mortgage assessments has become essential.###Research QuestionThis project explores the following research question: "How can geospatial data be utilized to enhance mortgage risk assessments, particularly in relation to flood risk?" This question is pertinent as it addresses the need for a more comprehensive and data-driven approach to mortgage risk evaluation, which is increasingly relevant in today's climate-sensitive environment.###RationaleThe proposed research question is a strong candidate for a data-driven solution due to the availability of geospatial and property data, the advancements in geocoding technologies, and the increasing necessity for environmental risk assessments in financial decision-making. By integrating geospatial analysis with mortgage data, (credit) risk officers, investors or regulators can provide a nuanced understanding of flood risks, offering significant value to stakeholders. ##Methods###Data Sources
1. Property and Mortgage Data: Sample mortgage data including addresses, loan amounts, and property values.
2. Geospatial Data: Shapefiles representing geographical features and flood-prone areas: https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/fc3df1e4-4eb4-4013-8bf2-300089857801/indicative-flood-risk-areas-communities-at-risk-data  
https://www.getthedata.com/flood-map-by-postcode
https://www.rightmove.co.uk/house-prices/b17/osmaston-road.html         ###Data Cleaning1. Geocoding: Addresses were geocoded to obtain latitude and longitude coordinates.
2. Handling Missing Data: Properties with missing geocodes were flagged and reviewed to ensure data integrity.###Analytical Methods1. Flood Risk Simulation: A custom function simulates flood risk based on property type and proximity to water bodies, incorporating random variability.
2. Risk Classification: Flood risk scores are categorized into 'Low', 'Moderate', and 'High' risk levels.
3. Geospatial Visualization: Utilizes Folium to map properties and overlay shapefiles for enhanced spatial analysis.

##Results
# ###Descriptive Statistics
1. Sample Data: Includes three properties with varying loan amounts and property values.
2. Geocoding Outcomes: Successfully geocoded addresses provided precise latitude and longitude for mapping.###Graphical Representation1. Flood Risk Distribution: Histogram showing the distribution of simulated flood risk scores.
2. Loan Risk Categories: Pie chart illustrating the proportion of properties in each risk category.###Analysis1. Spatial Visualization: Interactive map displaying properties, flood risk scores, and shapefile overlays.
2. Risk Assessment Insights: Identified high-risk areas and properties, enabling targeted risk mitigation strategies.##ConclusionThis project demonstrates the efficacy of using geospatial data for mortgage risk assessment, specifically focusing on flood risk. By integrating geocoding and shapefile data, I provided a detailed analysis that enhances traditional risk evaluation methods. The results highlight the importance of considering environmental risks in mortgage assessments.##Recommendations1. Further Data Integration: Incorporate additional environmental risk factors such as fire or earthquake risks.
2. Model Refinement: Enhance the flood risk simulation model with more granular data on water bodies and historical flood events.
3. Stakeholder Engagement: Collaborate with financial institutions to validate the model and refine it based on real-world feedback.
4. This approach not only aids in better risk management but also aligns financial decision-making with sustainability and resilience goals.
