Introduction

Accurate risk assessment is crucial for mortgage lenders and investors, especially in the context of increasing environmental risks due to climate change. This project addresses the need for a data-driven approach to evaluate mortgage risks by considering flood risk, a significant factor affecting property values and loan default rates.

Features

Manual input for property address, loan amount, and property value.
Geocoding to obtain latitude and longitude coordinates for properties.
Flood risk simulation based on property type and proximity to water bodies.
Risk classification into 'Low', 'Moderate', and 'High' risk levels.
Integration with shapefiles for enhanced spatial analysis.
Interactive map visualization using Folium.

Data Sources

Property and Mortgage Data: Sample mortgage data including addresses, loan amounts, and property values.
Geospatial Data: Shapefiles representing geographical features and flood-prone areas.

Future Work

Additional Environmental Risks: Integrate other risks such as fire and earthquake.
Model Enhancements: Refine the flood risk simulation model with more granular data.
Collaboration: Engage with financial institutions for model validation and improvement.
